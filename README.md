The scope of this research is to solve HR-related problems in a multinational corporation, more precisely, to predict the employee promotion potential. 
The difficulty of the company is recognizing the right person for promotion and prepare them in time. The thing is that the company can announce the promotions only after conducting the evaluation of employees, which causes impediments in the transition of new positions. 
Consequently, the company lacks guidance in identifying suitable candidates at a particular checkpoint to facilitate the entire promotion period. 
This study examines the effects of age, education level, gender, department, number of average training scores, and awards won by an employee, recruitment channel on the probability of getting promoted.
